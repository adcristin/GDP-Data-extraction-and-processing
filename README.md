# GDP-Data-extraction-and-processing
**Project Summary**
Built a dynamic data pipeline that extracts, cleans, transforms, and ranks global GDP (Nominal) data to identify the Top 10 largest economies in the world based on IMF estimates. The pipeline processes raw web data, converts GDP values from million USD to billion USD, rounds them to 2 decimal places, and exports a structured CSV file ready for analytics or reporting. This project demonstrates practical skills in data extraction, transformation, and automation using Python.

**Tech Stack**
- Python
- Pandas: Data txtraction and transformation
- Numpy: Numerical processing and rounding
- Webscraping: pandas.read_html()
- CSV handling
